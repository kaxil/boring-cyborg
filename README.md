# Boring Cyborg

ðŸ¤– A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automatically label PRs, issues and 
performs all the boring operations that you don't want to do.

![Congratulate user on first merged PR](./assets/usage-first-merged-pr.gif)

![Verifies that commit title matches regexp (single commit)](./assets/usage-wrong-commit-title.png)

![Verifies that PR title matches regexp (multiple commits)](./assets/usage-wrong-PR-title.png)

## Features

* Add labels based on the path of the file that are modified in the PR.
* Welcome new users to your project when they open their first Issue/PR or first merged PR by an
automated comment.
* Insert Issue (Jira/Github etc) link in PR description based on the Issue ID in PR title.
* Verifies if commits/PR titles match the regular expression specified
* Check if a branch is up to date with the master when specific files are modified in the PR. 
This is helpful when you desire the changes to be applied sequentially, for example, alembic migrations.

## Usage

1. **[Configure the Github App](https://github.com/apps/boring-cyborg)**
2. After installing the Github app, create `.github/boring-cyborg.yml` in the default branch to enable it
3. It will start scanning for pull requests within few minutes.

```yaml
##### Labeler ########################################################################################################## 
# Enable "labeler" for your PR that would add labels to PRs based on the paths that are modified in the PR.
labelPRBasedOnFilePath:
  # Add 'label1' to any changes within 'example' folder or any subfolders
  label1:
    - example/**/*
  
  # Add 'label2' to any file changes within 'example2' folder
  label2: 
    - example2/*

  # Complex: Add 'area/core' label to any change within the 'core' package
  area/core:
    - src/core/*
    - src/core/**/*  

  # Add 'test' label to any change to *.spec.js files within the source dir
  test:
    - src/**/*.spec.js

###### IssueLink Adder #################################################################################################
# Insert Issue (Jira/Github etc) link in PR description based on the Issue ID in PR title.
insertIssueLinkInPrDescription:
   # specify the placeholder for the issue link that should be present in the description
  descriptionIssuePlaceholderRegexp: "^Issue link: (.*)$"
  matchers:
    # you can have several matches - for different types of issues
    # only the first matching entry is replaced
    jiraIssueMatch:
      # specify the regexp of issue id that you can find in the title of the PR
      # the match groups can be used to build the issue id (${1}, ${2}, etc.).
      titleIssueIdRegexp: \[(AIRFLOW-[0-9]{4})\]
      # the issue link to be added. ${1}, ${2} ... are replaced with the match groups from the
      # title match (remember to use quotes)
      descriptionIssueLink: "[${1}](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/${1}/)"
    docOnlyIssueMatch:
      titleIssueIdRegexp: \[(AIRFLOW-X{4})\]
      descriptionIssueLink: "`Document only change, no JIRA issue`"

###### Title Validator #################################################################################################
# Verifies if commit/PR titles match the regexp specified
verifyTitles:
  # Regular expression that should be matched by titles of commits or PR
  titleRegexp: ^\[AIRFLOW-[0-9]{4}\].*$|^\[AIRFLOW-XXXX\].*$
  # If set to true, it will only check the commit in case there is a single commit.
  # In case of multiple commits it will check PR title.
  # This reflects the standard behaviour of Github that for `Squash & Merge` GitHub
  # takes the title of the squashed commit from PR title rather than from commit message Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
  # For single-commit PRs it takes the squashed commit message from the commit as expected.
  #
  # If set to false it will check all commit messages. This is useful when you do not squash commits at merge.
  validateEitherPrOrSingleCommitTitle: true

###### PR/Branch Up-To-Date Checker ####################################################################################
# Check if the branch is up to date with master when certain files are modified
checkUpToDate:
  # The default branch is "master", change the branch if you want to check against a different target branch  
  targetBranch: master
  files:
  # File paths that you want to check for
  # In this example, it checks if the branch is up to date when alembic migrations are modified in the PR.
  # It helps avoid multiple heads in alembic migrations in a collaborative development project.
    - airflow/migrations/*
    - airflow/migrations/**/*
    - airflow/alembic.ini
```

All the features are optional. Simply add the config for the feature you want to use.
